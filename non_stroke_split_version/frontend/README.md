# Non-Stroke Split Version FrontEnd
The frontend is written using the Vue framework and communicates with the backend through the axios library. It uses Canvas to draw related content. Please start the backend algorithm service before executing the frontend project.

## QuickStart
1. install requirements
```
npm install
```
2. modify config
open src/config.js, modify backend request url

3. run
```
npm run serve
```

## Usage：
The system only needs to upload a Zip compression package with the font bitmaps already designed by the designer. The Zip compression package should contain font bitmap images. An example Zip compression package can be downloaded from the following link:

Afterward, the system will automatically start training, and under normal circumstances, it will take 1-2 days for the training to complete. After training, you can perform relevant vectorization operations within the system. You can also directly access the corresponding folder in the backend to check the results.
